        Parameters
        ----------
        where_clause : str
            A SQL WHERE clause to filter the data in the `stats_table` CTE.

        Notes
        -----
        The query uses three Common Table Expressions (CTEs): `temporal`,
        `stats_table`, and `stats_path_table`.
        The `temporal` CTE calculates the average statistics for each player
        in each season.
        The `stats_table` CTE applies the `where_clause` filter to the
        `temporal` CTE.
        The `stats_path_table` CTE joins the `stats_table` CTE with the
        `players_career_path` table and applies the `league_clause` filter.
        The final query selects the desired columns from the `stats_path_table`
        CTE and joins it with the `players_info` table to get the player names.
